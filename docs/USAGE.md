### 1 Data Format

---

​		`gStore` is a graph database engine based on the RDF model, and its data format follows the RDF model. RDF, the W3C standard for describing real-world resources, is a general way to describe information so that it can be read and understood by computer applications. Any entity in the real world can be represented as a resource in the RDF model, such as a book's title, author, modification date, content, and copyright information. These resources can be used to abstract concepts, entities, and events from the objective world in the knowledge graph. An attribute of each resource and its attribute value, or its relationship to other resources, is called a piece of knowledge. Properties and relationships can be represented as triples.  

​		A triad consists of three elements: Subject, Property 1, and Object. It usually describes the relationship between two resources or some Property of a resource. When a triple describes the attributes of a resource, its three elements are also called body, attribute, and Property Value. For example, the triad "Aristotle, Birthplace, Chalcis" expresses the fact that Aristotle was born in Chalcis.

​       Using these properties and relationships, a large number of resources can be linked together to form a large RDF knowledge graph dataset. Therefore, a knowledge graph can often be viewed as a collection of triples. These collections of triples, in turn, form an RDF dataset. The triplet set of knowledge graph can be stored in relational database or graph database.

​      RDF data should be provided in n-triple format (XML is not currently supported), and queries must be provided in SPARQL1.1 syntax. The following is an example of the n-triple format file:        

```
@prefix foaf:  <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/> .	
_:a  foaf:name   "Johnny Lee Outlaw" .
_:a  foaf:mbox   <mailto:jlow@example.com> .
_:b  foaf:name   "Peter Goodguy" .
_:b  foaf:mbox   <mailto:peter@example.org> .
_:c  foaf:mbox   <mailto:carol@example.org> .
```

Triples are typically stored in the W3C-defined NT file format and represent three RDF data, where the values wrapped in `<` and `>`are urIs of an entity, and the values wrapped in '"" are literals representing the value of an attribute of the entity, followed by'`^^ `to indicate the type of the value. The following three RDF data points represent two attributes of `John`, `gender` and `age`, with values of `male` and `28` respectively. The last one indicates that `John` and `Li` have a `friend` relationship.

```NT
<John> <gender> "male"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#String>.
<John> <age> "28"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#Int>.
<John> <friend> <Li>.
```

​    More specific information about N-Triple please check [N-Triple](https://www.w3.org/TR/n-triples/). Not all syntax in SPARQL1.1 is parsed and answered in gStore; for example, property paths are beyond the capabilities of the gStore system.

### 2 Initialize the system database

---

As soon as you download and compile the code for the gStore system, a database named System (the real directory name system.db) is automatically created. This is the database that manages system statistics, including all users and all databases. You can query this database using the gquery command, but do not modify it using the editor. 

The `system` database is the built-in system database of gStore. This database cannot be deleted. It is used to store the information related to the system, especially the information of the built database  

#### 2.1 Command line mode(ginit)

ginit is used to initialize the database

instruction：

```shell
bin/ginit -db [db_name1],[db_name2],[...]
```

command parameter：

```
db_name1：database name
```

If no database names are written, the reinitialized `system` database will have no other database information

example：

```shell
[root@localhost gStore]$ bin/ginit -db lubm
================================================================================
UPDATE
Insert:
{
	<system>	<built_time>	"2021-02-21 22:50:05".
	<lubm>	<database_status>	"already_built".
	<lubm>	<built_by>	<root>.
	<lubm>	<built_time>	"2021-02-21 22:50:05".
}
================================================================================
parse query  successfully! .
unlock the query_parse_lock .
after Parsing, used 96ms.
write priviledge of update lock acquired
QueryCache cleared
Total time used: 97ms.
update num : 4
system.db is built successfully!
```

### 3 Create database

---

Creating a database is one of the most important operations in gStore. It is also the first operation that users need to perform after gStore installation. gStore provides multiple methods to create a database.  

#### 3.1 Command line mode (gbuild)

The gbuild command is used to create a new database from an RDF file:

```shell
bin/gbuild -db dbname -f filename  
```

Parameter definition：

	dbname：database name
	filename：filepath of files with ".nt" or ".n3" as suffix

For example, we build a database called "lubm.db" from lubm.nt, which can be found in the data folder.

```shell
[root@localhost gStore]$ bin/gbuild -db lubm -f ./data/lubm/lubm.nt 
gbuild...
argc: 3 DB_store:lubm      RDF_data: ./data/lubm/lubm.nt  
begin encode RDF from : ./data/lubm/lubm.nt ...
```

Note：

- You cannot create a database from an empty RDF dataset
- Note that you cannot directly `CD` into the `bin` directory. Instead, you need to perform the gbuild operation in the gStore installation root director



#### 3.2 Visual tool (gWorkbench)

gWorkbench is a visual management tool of gStore. Through gWorkbench, you can connect to gStore and create a graph database through database management module. For details, see [Development document] - [Visual Tool Workbench] - [query function] - [database management] function].



#### 3.3 HTTP API (ghttp)

gStore provides GHTTP component as HTTP API service component. Users can realize relevant functions by sending HTTP requests to ghttp In ghttp, graph database is constructed by `build` request. 



#### 3.4 Socket API (gServer)

gStore provides gServer component as Socket API service component. Users can realize related functions by sending Socket request to gServer. gServer builds graph database through `build` request. See [Development document] - [Common API] - [gServer interface Description] for details.

### 4 Database list

---

The database list function is used to obtain information about all available databases in the following formats

#### 4.1 Command line mode (gshow)

instruction：

```shell
bin/gshow
```

example：

```shell
[root@localhost gStore]$ bin/gshow 
========================================
database: system
creator: root
built_time: "2019-07-28 10:26:00"

### 6 Database query

---

​       Database query is one of the most important functions of gStore. gStore supports SPARQL 1.1 query language defined by W3C. Users can use the gStore database query function in the following ways.

#### 6.1 Command line mdoe（gquery)

gquery is used to query existing databases using files containing SPARQL queries. (Each file contains an exact SPARQL statement. SPARQL statements can be used not only for queries, but also for additions and deletions. For details on SPARQL statements, see Chapter 8.)  

1.To query the database named db name, enter the following command:

```shell
bin/gquery -db db_name -q query_file 
```

parameter definition： 

	db_name: database name
	query_file：The path to the SPARQL statement ending with ".sql "(other name extensions are acceptable)

For example, we execute the SPARQL statement in./data/lubm/ lubM_q0.sql to query the LUBM database.

The query result is：

```shell
[root@localhost gStore]$ bin/gquery -db lubm -f ./data/lubm/lubm_q0.sql
There has answer: 15
final result is :
?x
<http://www.Department0.University0.edu/FullProfessor0>
<http://www.Department1.University0.edu/FullProfessor0>
<http://www.Department2.University0.edu/FullProfessor0>

```

2.To learn more about how to use gQuery, enter the following command:

```shell
bin/gquery --help
```

3. Command to enter gquery console:

```shell
bin/gquery -db dbname
```

he program displays a command prompt (" gsql > ") where you can enter command:

>Use `help` to see the basic information for all commands

>Enter `quit` to exit the gquery console

>For the `sparql` command, use `sparQL query_file` to execute the SPARQL query statement, and query_file indicates the path of the file storing the SPARQL statement. When the program finishes answering the query, it displays the command prompt again
>
>We use lubm.nt as example。

```shell
(base) [root@iz8vb0u9hafhzz1mn5xcklz gStore]# bin/gquery -db lubm

gsql>sparql ./data/lubm/lubm_q0.sql

gStore provides ghttp component as http API service component, users can realize related functions by sending http request to ghttp, ghttp through `query` request to query graph database, including query, delete, insert, See [Development document] - [common API] - [ghttp interface Description] for details.



#### 6.4 Socket API（gServer）

gStore provides gServer component as Socket API service component. Users can realize related functions by sending Socket request to gServer. gServer can query graph database through `query` request, including query, delete and insert. See [Development document] - [Common API] - [gServer interface Description] for details.

### 7 Database export

---

The export database function enables you to export a database as an. Nt file. There are three forms:

#### 7.1 Command line mode (gexport)

gexport is used to export database.

instruction：

```shell
bin/gexport -db db_name -f path 
```

parameter definition：

```
db_name：database name
path：Export to specified folder (if empty, export to gStore root by default)
```

example：

```shell
[root@localhost gStore]# bin/gexport -db lubm	
after Handle, used 0 ms.
QueryCache didn't cache
after tryCache, used 0 ms.
in getFinal Result the first half use 0  ms
after getFinalResult, used 0ms.
Total time used: 1ms.
finish exporting the database.
```

### 8 Database deletion

---

Deleting a database You can delete a database in the following three ways

#### 8.1 Command line mode (gdrop)

gdrop is use to delete database

instruction：

```shell
bin/gdrop -db db_name
```

parameter definition：

```
db_name：database name
```

example：

```shell
[root@localhost gStore]$ bin/drop -db lubm2
after tryCache, used 0 ms.
QueryCache cleared
Total time used: 97ms.
update num : 3
lubm2.db is dropped successfully!
```

To delete the database, you should not just type `rm -r db_name. Db` because this will not update the built-in database named `system`. Instead, you should type `bin/ gdrop-db db_name`.



#### 8.2 Visual tool（gWorkbench)

gWorkbench is a visual management tool of gStore. Through gWorkbench, you can connect to gStore and create a graph database through database management module. For details, see [Development document] - [Visual Tool Workbench] - [query function] - [database management] function].



#### 8.3 HTTP API（ghttp）

gStore provides ghttp component as http API service component, users can send http request to ghttp to achieve relevant functions, ghttp through the `drop` command to achieve relevant functions, details see [development document] - [common API] - [ghttp interface description]  



#### 8.4 Socket API（gServer）

gStore provides gServer component as Socket API service component. Users can realize related functions by sending Socket request to gServer. gServer can delete graph database by `drop` request. See [Development document] - [Common API] - [gServer interface Description] for details.

### 9 Additional data

---

Inserting RDF data is a routine gStore operation, and you can do it in one of the following ways.

#### 9.1 Command line mode（gadd)--file

gadd is use to insert triples from a file into an existing database.

instruction：

```shell
bin/gadd -db db_name -f rdf_triple_file_path
```

parameter definition：

	db_name：database name
	rdf_triple_file_path：The file path with the suffix ".nt" or ".n3"

example：

```shell
[bookug@localhost gStore]$ bin/gadd -db lubm -f ./data/lubm/lubm.nt
...
argc: 3 DB_store:lubm   insert file:./data/lubm/lubm.nt
get important pre ID
...
insert rdf triples done.
inserted triples num: 99550
```

** Note: **  

**1. Gadd is primarily used for data insertion into RDF files **  

**2. Do not go directly to the 'bin' directory. Instead, perform the 'gadd' operation in the gStore installation root directory **

#### 9.2 Command line mode（gquery)---SPARQL statement

SPARQL can be defined by `insert data` instruction to insert data. Based on this principle, users can also write SPARQL insert statements and then use gStore's `gQuery` tool to insert data. Examples of SPARQL insert statements are as follows:

```sql
insert data {
 <张三> <性别> "男"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#String>.
 <张三> <年龄> "28"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#Int>.
 <张三> <好友> <李四>.
}
```

Multiple RDF data can be contained with `{}`, taking care that each one ends with a `. `  

Since the database query function can be used to insert data, the following functions can also be used to insert data.



#### 9.3 Visual tool （gWorkbench)

gWorkbench is a visual management tool of gStore. Through gWorkbench, you can connect to gStore and create a graph database through database management module. For details, see [Development document] - [Visual Tool Workbench] - [query function] - [database management] function].



#### 9.4 HTTP API（ghttp）

gStore provides ghttp component as AN http API service component. Users can realize relevant functions by sending http requests to ghttp. ghttp inserts data through `query` request and batch inserts data through `batchInsert`. See [Development document] - [common API] - [ghttp interface Description] for details.



#### 9.5 Socket API（gServer）

gStore provides gServer component as Socket API service component. Users can implement related functions by sending Socket requests to gServer. gServer inserts data through 'query' requests. See [Development document] - [Common API] - [gServer interface Description] for details.

### 10 Data deletion

---

Deleting RDF data is a routine gStore operation, and you can perform this operation in the following ways.

#### 10.1 Command line mode（gsub）--file deletion

gsub is used to remove triples from files in an existing database.

instruction：

```
bin/gsub db_name rdf_triple_file_path
```

parameter definition：

	rdf_triple_file_path：The path to the data file to be deleted with the suffix ".nt" or ".n3"

example：

    [root@localhost gStore]$ bin/gsub lubm ./data/lubm/lubm.nt
    ...
    argc: 3 DB_store:lubm  remove file: ./data/lubm/lubm.nt
    ...
    remove rdf triples done.
    removed triples num: 99550



#### 10.2 Command line mode（gquery)---SPARQL statement

SPARQL can be defined by 'delete data' instruction to insert data. Based on this principle, users can also write SPARQL insert statements and then use gStore's `gQuery` tool to insert data. Examples of SPARQL insert statements are as follows:

```
delete data {
 <张三> <性别> "男"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#String>.
<张三> <年龄> "28"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#Int>.
<张三> <好友> <李四>.
}
```

Multiple RDF data can be contained with '{}', taking care that each one ends with a `. `

SPARQL also allows you to delete data based on a subquery structure using the 'DELETE WHERE' statement, as shown below

```
delete where
{
   <张三> ?x ?y.
}
```

This statement deletes all information (including attributes and relationships) about an entity

Since the database query function can be used to insert data, the following functions can also be used to insert data



#### 10.3 Visual tool（gWorkbench)

gWorkbench is a visual management tool for gStore. Through gWorkbench, you can connect to gStore and delete data by writing SPARQL statements through database query module. See [Development document] - [Visualization Tool Workbench] - [query function] - [Graph database query] for details.  



#### 10.4 HTTP API（ghttp）

gStore provides ghttp component as http API service component, users can send http request toghttp to achieve relevant functions, ghttp through `query` request to delete data and `batchRemove` to delete data in batches. See [Development document] - [common API] - [ghttp interface Description] for details



#### 10.5 Socket API（gServer）

gStore provides gServer component as Socket API service component. Users can realize related functions by sending Socket requests to gServer. gServer can delete data through `query` requests. See [Development document] - [Common API] - [gServer interface Description] for details.

- <database_name>: cannot be `system`
- <nt_file_path>：file path

```
gstore> create eg my_test_data/eg_rdf.nt;
... (this is build database process output, omitted in this document)
Database eg created successfully
```

##### Delete database

```
drop <database_name>
```

-  Cannot delete the current database
-  <database_name>：can only be specified as the name of a database for which the current user has full permissions

```
gstore> drop <database_name>;
```

##### Load/Switch database

```
use <database_name>
```

- Load/switch the current database: unload the previous current database from memory (if any) and load the specified database
- The target database needs to have been created
- <database_name>：can only be specified as the name of a database for which the current user have load and unload permissions

```
gstore> use mytest;
... (this is load process output, omitted in this document)
Current database switch to mytest successfully.
```

##### Query/update database

- Run a SPARQL query on the current database
- You need to specify the current database first by`use <database_name>`

###### Inputting a SPARQL query

```bash
gstore> # show all in db
	-> SELECT ?x ?y ?z
	-> WHERE{
	-> ?x ?y ?z. # comment
	-> } ;
... (this is query process output, omitted in this document)
final result is :
?x ?y ?z
<root> <has_password> "123456"
<system> <built_by> <root>
<CoreVersion> <value> "1.0.0"
query database successfully, Used 15 ms
```

Example of redirection (all commands support redirecting output):

```bash
gstore> # support redirect
	-> SELECT ?x ?y ?z
	-> WHERE{
	-> ?x ?y ?z.
	-> } > my_test_data/output ;
Redirect output to file: my_test_data/output
```

###### sparql <sparql_file>

- Specify the sparql file: the file contains multiple sparql statements that need to be separated by `;` and the last `;` is optional
- The file content supports single-line comments starting with #

```bash
gstore> sparql query.sparql ;
... (this is query process output, omitted in this document)
final result is :

<root> <has_password> "123456"
<system> <built_by> <root>
<CoreVersion> <value> "1.0.0"
query database successfully, Used 15 ms
```

- An example of query.sparql content:

```sql
# comment
SELECT ?t1_time
WHERE
{
	# comment
	<t1><built_time>?t1_time. # comment
};
# comment
SELECT ?t2_time
WHERE
{
	# comment
	<t2><built_time>?t2_time. # comment
};
```

#### 11.5 Permissions management

Only system users have the permission to execute commands related to permissions management. The permissions descriptions are as follows:

- Permissions: the operations a user is permitted to carry out on a database

- 7 types of permissions: `query`, `load`, `unload`, `update`, `backup`, `restore`, `export`

    ```
    [1]query [2]load [3]unload [4]update [5]backup [6]restore [7]export
    ```

     Users who have all seven permissions are considered to have full permissions.

- System users have full permissions on all databases. (System users are defined in conf.ini and system.db.)

##### Set user's permissions

```
setpriv <usrname> <database_name>
```

- A password is required to verify root identity.
- <usrname> : the user name to be set.

### 12 HTTP API service  

---

GStore provides two sets of http API services, namely grpc and ghttp. Users can remotely connect to and operate on gStore by sending http requests.

#### 12.1 Starting ghttp/gRPC service

After gStore is compiled, a ghttp service and a gRPC service is displayed in the bin directory of gStore. However, the service is not started by default. You need to manually start the service: 

```bash
nohup bin/grpc -db db_name -p serverPort -c enable &
```

```bash
nohup bin/ghttp -db db_name -p serverPort -c enable &
```

Parameters:

```
db_name: The name of the database to start HTTP (Optional; The effect of this parameter is that when starting the HTTP service, the related information of the database will be loaded into memory.)

serverPort: the HTTP listening port. You need to ensure that this port is not prohibited by the server firewall. (Optional; if this port is not specified, the default port is 9000).

enable: whether to load CSR resources. 0 indicates no and 1 indicates yes. (Optional, for built-in advanced functions or user-defined graph analysis functions. The default value is 0.)
```

`ghttp` and `grpc` both support GET and POST request types.

Concurrent read-only queries are supported, but when a query containing updates arrives, the
entire database is locked. On a computer with dozens of kernel threads, the recommended
number of queries to run concurrently is less than 300, but we were able to run 13,000 queries
simultaneously in our experiment. To use the concurrency feature, it is best to set the number of open files and the maximum number of processes to 65535 or greater in the system settings.

**It is recommended to periodically execute the `checkpoint` command  to the console if you frequently send query containing updates. Otherwise, updates may not be synced with the disk, and will be lost if the server stops abnormally (for example, because of typing "Ctrl + C") **

#### 12.2 Shutting down the service

For safety, please use the following command to shut down the service instead of `Ctrl + C` or `kill`.

```bash
bin/shutdown
```

#### 12.3 HTTP API

ghttp and gRPC provide a rich API interface so that users can remotely operate most of the functions of gStore. For details, please see [Development document] - [common API] - [ghttp interface Description]  or [gRPC interface Description].

### 12 Socket API service

---

gServer is an external access interface provided by gStore and a Socket API service. Users can connect and operate gStore remotely through two-way socket communication.

#### 12.1 Start gServer service

After gStore is compiled, a gServer service is displayed in the bin directory of gStore. However, the gServer service is not started by default. You need to manually start the gServer service:

```shell
bin/gserver -s
```

Other optional parameters:

```
-t,--stop: shutdown gserver service;
-r,--restart：restart gserver service；
-p,--port：Modify the socket connection port configuration. The default port is 9000. After the modification, restart the GServer service
-P,--printport：pritn current socket connection port configuration
-d,--debug：start debug mode（keep gserver service running in the foreground）
-k,--kill：Forcibly stop the service. You are advised to stop the service only when the service cannot be stopped
```



#### 12.2 Shutdown gServer service

To stop the gServer service, use the following command to stop it. It is better not to simply enter the command 'Ctrl + C' or 'kill' to stop the gServer, because it is not safe.  

```shell
bin/gserver -t
```



#### 12.3 gServer related API

gServer provides rich API interfaces so that users can remotely operate most functions of gStore. See [Development document] - [common API] - [gServer interface Description] for specific interfaces.
